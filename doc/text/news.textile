h2(#1-0-4). 1.0.4 - 2014-09-07

Bug fixes release.

h3. Fixes

  * Used the correct class to be extended for running tests by @Test::Unit@ .
    @ActiveSupport::TestCase@ is used now but before @Test::Unit::TestCase@ was.
    @ActiveSupport::TestCase@ (but @TestUnit::TestCase@ ) is inherited
    by @ActionController::TestCase@ (for controller tests) and
    @ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest@ (for integration tests).

h2(#1-0-3). 1.0.3 - 2014-09-04

h3. Improvements

  * Supported Rails 4.0.0.
    After this version, test-unit-rails requires test-unit-activesupport
    1.0.2 or later.
    In this version, test-unit-rails drops to support rails 3.2.16 or older.
    If you want to use this gem with Rails 3.2.16 or older, please use
    1.0.2 version.
